Counter([iterable-or-mapping])  # Creates a counter object that counts the occurrences of elements in an iterable or mapping.

defaultdict(default_factory)  # A dictionary that provides a default value for nonexistent keys.

OrderedDict([items])  # A dictionary that maintains the order of keys based on insertion.

namedtuple(typename, field_names, *, rename=False, defaults=None, module=None)  # Creates a tuple subclass with named fields.

deque(iterable, maxlen=None)  # A double-ended queue for fast appends and pops from both ends.

ChainMap(*maps)  # Groups multiple dictionaries or mappings into a single view.

UserDict(initialdata=None)  # A wrapper around dictionaries for easier subclassing.

UserList(initiallist=None)  # A wrapper around list objects for easier subclassing.

UserString(initialvalue='')  # A wrapper around string objects for easier subclassing.

product(*iterables, repeat=1)  # Computes the Cartesian product of the input iterables, allowing for multiple repetitions if specified.

variations(iterable, r)  # Generates all possible ordered variations of r elements from the iterable, ensuring no repetitions of elements.

groupby(data, key=lambda x: x[0])  # Groups adjacent elements in an iterable based on a specified key.

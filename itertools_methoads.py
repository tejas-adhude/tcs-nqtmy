
"""
combinations(iterable, r): Generates all unique combinations of r elements from the input iterable without regard to the order.

combinations_with_replacement(iterable, r): Similar to combinations, but allows elements to be repeated in combinations.

permutations(iterable, r=None): Produces all possible ordered permutations of r elements from the iterable, with the default being the length of the iterable.

product(*iterables, repeat=1): Computes the Cartesian product of the input iterables, allowing for multiple repetitions if specified.

variations(iterable, r): Generates all possible ordered variations of r elements from the iterable, ensuring no repetitions of elements.

groupby(data, key=lambda x: x[0])   The groupby function in Python is a powerful tool for grouping adjacent elements in an iterable based on a specified key
